# Phase Field Dislocation Dynamics (PFDD) version 2.x

PFDD is used for investigating deformation in nanoscale (grain sizes of ~300 nm and less) materials, such as metals and alloys. This approach models the motion and interaction of individual defects, namely dislocations, in the material using scalar-valued phase field variables, also called order parameters. The system is evolved through energy minimization thus the model calculates the total energy density in terms of the phase field variables. The energy minimization is completed using the Ginzburg-Landau equation, and is implemented with explicit time integration. The total system energy can be comprised of several terms, including the strain energy (which describes dislocation-dislocation interactions), the energy due to an applied stress (dislocation interactions with the applied stress), and a core/lattice (perfect dislocations) or generalized stacking fault (partial dislocations) energy (described the dislocation core structure).  The latter term in particular may vary based on the crystal structure being modeled and is typically informed using lower length scale (e.g., atomistic) approaches, although no such (atomistic) calculations are completed within the PFDD algorithm. This basic formulation was previously reviewed by Los Alamos National Laboratory and released under license number C17113. This previously version PFDD v1.0 can be found on:

PFDD v2.0 is restructured and modularized from PFDD v1.0, and is now written in both C and C++ languages. New features include:
new options of non-orthogonal computational grids;
model Frank-Read sources;
model dislocation cross-slip behavior;
model multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs);
and non-Schmid effects in metals.

PFDD relies on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is built separately and not included in PFDD. Any FFT solver can be employed, but as posted in the repo the current version is set-up to use [FFTW 2.1.5](https://www.fftw.org/download.html).
