/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
line.

E: One or more sites have invalid values

The application only allows sites to be initialized with specific
values.

E: Invalid site index
Site index must be positive and smaller or equal than the total
number of sites.
